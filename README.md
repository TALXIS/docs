# TALXIS Documentation

This repo holds the documentation for [TALXIS](https://www.talxis.com) which is maintained primarily by [NETWORG](https://www.networg.com). If you feel like something is missing, feel free to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) by submitting a pull request.

## Cloning the Docsy Example Project

The following will give you a project that is set up and ready to use (don't forget to use `--recurse-submodules` or you won't pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site). The `hugo server` command builds and serves the site. If you just want to build the site, run `hugo` instead.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/TALXIS/docs
cd docsy-example
hugo server
```

The theme is included as a Git submodule:

```bash
▶ git submodule
 a053131a4ebf6a59e4e8834a42368e248d98c01d themes/docsy (heads/master)
```

If you want to do SCSS edits and want to publish these, you need to install `PostCSS` (not needed for `hugo server`):

```bash
npm install
```

<!--### Cloning the Example from the Theme Project

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/docsy.git
cd tech-doc-hugo-theme/exampleSite
HUGO_THEMESDIR="../.." hugo server
```


Note that the Hugo Theme Site requires the `exampleSite` to live in a subfolder of the theme itself. To avoid recursive duplication, the example site is added as a Git subtree:

```bash
git subtree add --prefix exampleSite https://github.com/google/docsy.git  master --squash
```

To pull in changes, see `pull-deps.sh` script in the theme.-->

## Running the website locally

Once you've cloned the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```
hugo server
```
