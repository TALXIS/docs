## Introduction

The Tag Picker component extends the `Lookup` component from the `@talxis/base-controls library`. It provides a lookup-like functionality but visually represents selected values as colored tags. Internally, it utilizes the talxis_tag and talxis_taginstance entities to manage relationships between tags and target records.

## Manifest

| Property Name                 | Type            | Description                                                            |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Binding                       | SingleLine.Text | Binding field. It is used for data exchange when Tag Picker is nested. |
| Entity Name                   | SingleLine.Text | Target entity name for filtering tag instances.                        |
| Record Id                     | SingleLine.Text | Target record id for filtering tag instances                           |
| Scope Entity Name             | SingleLine.Text | Scoping entity name for filtering tags.                                |
| Scope Record Id               | SingleLine.Text | Scoping record id for filtering tags.                                  |
| Output Selected Tag Instances | Enum            | Select yes to ouput data to binding field.                             |
| Compact Mode                  | Enum            | Select yes to display pcf in compact mode.                             |
| Enable Navigation             | Enum            | Select yes to make tags clickable for editing purposes.                |

## Lookup Behavior Differences

Unlike a standard lookup, Tag Picker’s items are constructed from talxis_taginstance, which links talxis_tag with the target entity. The displayed name and color are retrieved from talxis_tag. When a tag is selected or removed, corresponding talxis_taginstance records are created or deleted. If a new tag is created directly via Tag Picker, both a talxis_tag and a talxis_taginstance record are generated.

## Data Handling with Dataverse

The TagPickerLogic class manages all interactions with Dataverse through the Web API. 

Selected tag instances can be retrieved in two ways:

- Using retrieveMultipleRecords: Filtering is performed via the target entity, and talxis_tag is expanded to obtain the name and color.
- Using binding property in nested PCF: When embedded in grids, selected tag instances with expanded tags are passed according to a defined interface.
  ```typescript
  export interface IBindingTagInstance {
    talxis_taginstanceid: string;
    talxis_tagid: {
      talxis_tagid: string;
      talxis_name: string;
      talxis_color: string | undefined;
    }
  }
  ```

## Compact Mode

For grid implementations, compact mode is available. This mode:

- Displays only the selected tags initially.
- Hides tags when the input gains focus and replaces them with a search bar. Also, it shows selected tags in suggestions callout.
- Displays tags dynamically. Tries to show all tags with their full names. If that is not possible, it displays as many tags as possible using the first letter of tag name, hiding the rest under an expand button.
