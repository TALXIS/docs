# Approvals Configuration
This part of the documentation is **important** for approval process to work properly. Without creating a configuration, the processes in the background don't work.

Configuration is done through **TALXIS Configuration - Purchase approval** entity records. You can find it in the **Settings area** in the TALXIS procurement application.

## Where to find the configuration
Purchase configuration records are located in the **Settings** area, in the **TALXIS Configuration - Purchase approval**
