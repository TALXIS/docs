# Configure processes

![Configuration Page](/.attachments/CustomizerGuide/Contract/configure-processes-1.png)

We have created a friendly configuration page where you'll find everything you need to configure for your processes.

You can change here for example length of the review or notice period, configure the electronic signature, or navigate to review and approval configuration. 

Each row has a hint to help you understand what you are configuring. The hint appears/disappears when you click on the blue bulb.

 The configuration page is located in the **Settings** area in the **Processes** subarea.
