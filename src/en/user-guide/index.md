# User guide

![TALXIS logo](/.attachments/ModelDrivenAppUserGuide/logo_with_borders.png)

Welcome to the **TALXIS user guide**! We are glad that you want to learn how to use the application in your organization or you are just interested in business applications. 

This documentation will guide you through the application, its components, where the components are located, and how to work with the entire application. 

First you will go through the individual components such as navigation menu, list of records, form and then we will approach the individual type of applications and their management.
