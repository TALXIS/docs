# Business process flow

An online process that walks users through a standard business process. For example, use a business process flow if you want everyone to handle customer service requests the same way, or to require staff to gain approval for an invoice before submitting an order.

Business process flows help everyone follow best practices, even for situations that don't occur very often. Where available, business processes provide a step-by-step timeline for the stages of a process at the top of the relevant record.

The new record must be saved before you can use **_Business process flow_**. 

Each **stage** contains a group of **steps**. Each step represents a column where data can be entered. You can advance to the next stage by using the **_Next Stage_** button.

Some of the **steps** are required so that people must enter data for a corresponding column before they can proceed to the next stage.
