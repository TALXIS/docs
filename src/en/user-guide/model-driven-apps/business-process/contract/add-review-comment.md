# Add review comment

When you are recognized by the system as one of the contract reviewers, you'll be notified via a task and an email. After you read the contract, you have two options how you can respond either from the app or from the email:

 1. Create comments and respond that you've commented on the contract
2. Respond that you haven't created any comments

## Notifications

### Task

When you are requested to comment on some contract, you'll be assigned a task regarding the contract. You can find it for example in the dashboard. You will find more about it right here: [Tasks during contract processes](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/business-process/contract/tasks-during-contract-processes/).

### Email

You'll receive an email notification once the review starts. The notification contains basic information about the contract and a link to an adaptive card that will be described lower.

When you click the link in the email, the adaptive card will pop up. You'll find there instructions and information about the contract. Using the buttons, you can open the contract record in the app, open the document for review in SharePoint or respond back.

## Add comment from the app

1. Open the task for contract review and go to prepared review comment record through **Regarding** attribute.

Here you will later finish the task, but first, you need to get to the document.

2. Navigate to the contract through the record header.

2. Read the contract.

In the middle of the contract form, there is the **Attachments** section where you'll find documents for review.

3. Navigate back using the **Go Back Arrow** or go to the **Review Comments** tab. Choose the **My Comments** view and find there a record created for your comment and open it.

Look for records with the highest **Review Round** and **Status Reason** equal **Active**.
