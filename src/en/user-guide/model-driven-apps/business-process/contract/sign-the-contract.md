# Sign the contract

Once a contract is approved by the representatives, the next in the process is a signature by a counterparty. You can choose to have the contract signed manually or electronically thanks to integration with [Signi](https://signi.com/).

## Manual signing

This option requires more user actions because it is not automatically sent for signature after approval. The user has to update the contract, so it would be in status **Sent for Signature**. After the contract is signed, the user has to upload the contract to SharePoint and finish the process.

As goes for previous stages, you'll be notified by tasks. You will find more about it right here: [Tasks during contract processes](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/business-process/contract/tasks-during-contract-processes/).

### Send for Signature

1. Navigate to the contract through the **Regarding** attribute in the assigned task.
2. Get the documents for signature from the **Attachments** section and send them to the counterparty.

5. Go back to the task of sending this contract and complete it.
6. Wait for the response from the counterparty.

You have two options after you receive the contract back from the counterparty.  You can either start a new review round if the counterparty has any comments or you can mark the contract as signed. You will find how to do it right below.

### Mark contract as signed

1. Navigate to the contract through the **Regarding** attribute in the assigned task.
2. Upload the signed documents to the **Attachments** section.

5. Click the **Confirm** button to finish the process.
6. Navigate back to the task and complete it.

### Start a new review round

Starting review at this point is similar to the one at the beginning of the whole contract process. The only difference here is that you have an option to create a new comment.

1. Navigate to the contract through the **Regarding** attribute in the assigned task for scanning and completing this document.
2. Click the **Start Review** button in the ribbon
