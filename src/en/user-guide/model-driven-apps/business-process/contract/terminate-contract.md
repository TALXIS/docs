# Terminate contract

To keep your contracts on track, you have an option to terminate them. When terminating a contract, you have an option to fill **Valid To** attribute if the contract validity doesn't end right away.


## How to terminate a contract

1. Navigate to an active contract you want to terminate.
2. Click the **Terminate Contract** button in the ribbon.

## Contract with amendments

If you terminate a contract with amendments, it will also end the amendments.

Valid amendments will have a new status reason **Cancelled**, and drafted ones will be **Discarded**.
