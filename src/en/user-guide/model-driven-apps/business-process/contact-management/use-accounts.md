# Use accounts to manage customer companies
Accounts are the organizations you work with within the application. They can also be partner companies or suppliers. If you use accounts, you'll usually also set up at least one contact for each of them, these contacts usually represent employees at the company.

## List of all accounts
You can view all created accounts in the application. To view them, just go to the **Organizations** group and you will see a view with accounts. In addition, the **Organizations** group is divided into customers, partners, suppliers for a better overview. If you don't know what views are, take a look at this page: [View records](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/basic-app-elements/views/).
