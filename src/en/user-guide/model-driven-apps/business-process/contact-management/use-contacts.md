# Use contacts to manage customer people

## Who is the contact?
Most of your contacts will represent customers or potential customers, but you might also include partners or suppliers among your contacts, especially for events where you'll also typically include speakers, vendors, and sponsors in your contacts database.

## List of all contacts
You can view all created contacts in the application. To view them, just go to the **Contacts** group and you will see a view with contacts. If you don't know what views are, take a look at this page: [View records](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/basic-app-elements/views/).

## Create a new contact
A new contact will be created using the form. If you don't know what forms are, check out this page: [Forms](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/basic-app-elements/forms/).

Let's create a new contact:
1. Go to **Contacts** and select **New** in the command bar.

## Deactivate contact 
You deactivate an account or contact rather than deleting it. This ensures the integrity of the audit trail associated with that record.

When a deactivated contact becomes inactive, it cannot be edited. However, it can still be used to establish new relationships with other records. All relationships created with the deactivated item are still available.

1. To deactivate a contact, press the **Deactivate** button and confirm it in the dialog.
