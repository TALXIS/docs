There are other tables on the activity dashboard such as My open unplanned activities, Active tasks blocked by me, etc.

## Set scheduled follow-up activity
If you are creating an activity from a timeline, the scheduled follow-up activity is set automatically by filling in the regarding field. However, if you create a new activity outside the timeline, you have the option to set an entry in the **Regarding** field.

You can then see the upcoming activities in the **Scheduled Follow-up section** or in **View**. 

This functionality is currently only available in **Sales application** for accounts, opportunities and leads.

_Scheduled follow-up activity takes a while to load, try a refreshnut view or form._
